        Nuno Ferreira Duarte is a Researcher at ISR-Lisboa in Instituto Superior Técnico. He received his Ph.D (Summa cum laude) in 2023. His PhD was a Joint-Degree between Instituto Superior Técnico (IST-Lisbon) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) advised by Professor José Santos-Victor and Professor Aude Billard. He received a M.Sc (Cum laude) from the University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST-Lisbon), Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR), advised by Professor Pedro U. Lima. He also interned at California Institute of Technology (Caltech SURF Program) under the supervision of Professor Richard Murray. \n
		His work bridges Robotics and Computer Vision with a focus on action understanding and object manipulation. He studies human physiological behavior and its connections to neurological and psychological processes to develop robot models that comprehend human actions. A key focus is using non-verbal cues as a shared communication language between humans and robots, enabling robots to both understand human actions and be understood by humans. He is also interested in studying robotic grasping from a vision-based background. The challenges that most intice him are distinguishing between careful and non-careful motions (important for fragile or dangerous objects), learning how to handle artifacts or fragments (crucial for archeology), and inferring objects’ shape from partial visual observations (necessary in household environments).	</p>
